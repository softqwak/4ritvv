# ScintillaNET-Components
A collection of Windows Forms components that interface with ScintillaNET v3.
I am using this project as a vehicle to learn about C#, WinForms, and various design patterns.

Includes:
* Incremental Search tool
* Find & Replace Dialog
* Go To Dialog
* Planned: Suggestion box (Autocomplete)

# ScintillaNET
[ScintillaNET v3](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET) is a Windows Forms control, wrapper, and bindings for the versatile [Scintilla](http://www.scintilla.org/) source code editing component. 

## Credits
All credit goes to [Jacob Slusser](https://github.com/jacobslusser) for writing and maintaining ScintillaNET v2.5 and v3.
Thanks to [Steve Towner](https://github.com/Stumpii) for creating [ScintillaNET-FindReplaceDialog](https://github.com/Stumpii/ScintillaNET-FindReplaceDialog), which served as an inspiration for this project.
